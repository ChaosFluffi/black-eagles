            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>Futaba is a young, bespectacled girl with hip length black hair dyed bright orange with straight-cut bangs and two long strands in the front along with a single small, thin ahoge strand at the top. Her brown eyes also seem to have some faint purple tones in them, appearing mauve. She wears large black circular glasses, and she is always seen wearing a set of AKG K845BT headphones with red earpads. She seems to be very short, even compared to other girls.</p>

            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>With a case of social anxiety bordering on agoraphobia, combined with the trauma of losing her mother Wakaba Isshiki, Futaba is strongly discomfited by going outside. When the protagonist first meets her, she is a hikikomori who does not attend school and almost never leaves her room. She communicates with the world remotely via the Internet, and her adoptive father Sojiro Sakura enables her lifestyle out of guilt that he could not protect her from trauma. Having disconnected herself from humanity and the world beyond her apartment, Futaba is lonely, lives without passion and enthusiasm, suffers from suicidal depression, and questions the point in her living. When first encountered, Futaba is so consumed with self-loathing that she suppresses her desire to live, causing her Shadow Self to develop a much more helpful personality than average, one who only desires Futaba's happiness. When she first leaves her room after her change of heart, she tends to hide behind the protagonist so that she won't be seen in public, or wears masks which make it impossible to identify her. Her room acts as a sanctuary and a refuge from the chaos and noise of the outside world.</p>
            <h2>Confidant</h2>
            <p>Her story progression revolves around her exposure to the outside world, as years of social isolation has left her completely maladjusted, and fulfilling a list of things which her mother made her do to help boost her social skills. Progressing the Confidant will unlock additional support abilities for Futaba to aid the party with in-battle through her Persona.</p>

          <h2>Persona</h2>
          <p>Necronomicon is Futaba Sakura's Initial Persona, formed when she regains her will to live and accepts a consenting Shadow Futaba. It is shaped like a UFO with a metallic Gargoyle statue crouching on its top. The UFO's exterior is decorated with lime green glyphs of various origins. Futaba is piloting from the inside. This Persona symbolizes Futaba's unknown power and vast reserves of knowledge. <br><br> Necronomicon is a navigator Persona with a limited array of skills by itself. However by progressing Futaba's Confidant, more abilities can be used through it, including ones that can aid in battle or ambushing Shadows.</p>
