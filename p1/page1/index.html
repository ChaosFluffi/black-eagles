<!--
Yet still I hide
Behind this mask that I have become
My blackened heart
Scorched by flames, a force I can’t run from

As I live out
Each peacful day
Deep in my soul
Oh, I know I can’t stay

So I wish I
Could hide away
Hold tight to what I love
Keep cruel fate at bay

As rain falls on the path
I chase your shadow
I don’t feel a single drop
Or the ground below

Then you turn to me and I
Stop before I know
And the lie upon my lips
I let it go

Cross my heart
Making vows I know will be betrayed
A sad girl’s pleas
Live only for a breath and then they fade

Don’t ever take
Back your kind hand
Lest precious love
Slip away like time’s sand

Only we will know
All that was lost
Scars that we can’t erase
Show us life’s true cost

The blue moonlight
Cuts across our sight
As pure and clear as a ringing bell
Reaching for us in the night

As the wind calms my thoughts
I have strung on this terrace
I feel the peace
Carried away by the wind’s song

Open the door
And walk away
Never give in
To the call of yesterday

Memories that made
Those day sublime
These ruined hall entomb
Stolen time-->
