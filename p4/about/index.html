          <h1>What are Amiibo?</h1>
          <p>Amiibo is a near field communication (NFC) based platform, developed by Nintendo. This optional enhancement platform allows compatible figurines to link with supported video games, allowing two-way transfer of data into and out of a supported game, and possibly between supported platforms. This is accomplished on Nintendo's Wii U console through the Wii U GamePad, through an NFC adapter on the Nintendo 3DS, and the Nintendo Switch (Right Joy-Con Stick) and Nintendo Switch Pro Controller. amiibo enables game data to be swapped directly between those two specific platforms for the first time, and does so in a fashion reminiscent of the Nintendo GameCube â€“ Game Boy Advance link cable of the early 2000s. The platform was officially unveiled on June 10, 2014 as part of Nintendo's E3 2014 presentation, with Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, Mario Kart 8, and Mario Party 10 being among the first games to support the platform.</p>
